    "1. Launch a live notebook server with these notebooks using [binder](https://beta.mybinder.org/). Access the binder at the following URL: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/liuxfiu/qmodels.git/master?filepath=notebooks%2Findex.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Run these notebooks available in this repository's [notebooks](../notebooks) directory on your own machine. To do that, you need to install the following packages:\n",
    "   * **jupyter**: a web application for sharing interactive documents that contain text, code, and data visualization\n",
    "   * **numpy**: a library for efficient representation of multi-dimensional arrays\n",
    "   * **scipy**: a library for numerical computations, including linear algebra and statistics\n",
    "   * **matplotlib**: a 2-D plotting library\n",
    "\n",
    "   You can install these packages using the `pip` command, such as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   python -m pip install --user jupyter numpy scipy matplotlib\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   You'll also need to install simulus. Check out [Simulus Quick Start](https://simulus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html) for installation instructions. The simplest method to install simulus is to run the `pip` command, such as:\n",

    "   ```\n",
