    "This repository contains a tutorial that describes how to use simulus to simulate queuing systems. Simulus is an open-source discrete-event simulator in Python. It aspires to be a part of the Python ecosystem in supporting scientific computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial consists of several Jupyter notebooks, on which we develop and run simulation code. To be able to run this tutorial inside Jupyter on your machine, the following packages need to be installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **jupyter**: a web application for sharing interactive documents that contain text, code, and data visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "* **numpy**: a library for efficient representation of multi-dimensional arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "* **scipy**: a library for numerical computations, including linear algebra and statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "* **matplotlib**: a 2-D plotting library\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install these packages using the `pip` command, such as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python -m pip install --user jupyter numpy scipy matplotlib\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also need to install simulus. Check out [Quick Start](https://simulus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html) for installation instructions. The simplest method to install simulus is to run the `pip` command, such as:\n",
